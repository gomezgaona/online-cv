  summary: |
    I am an Assistant Professor at Fort Lewis College, specializing in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics. 
    My academic career is supported by a Ph.D. in Informatics from the University of South Carolina, where I conducted research 
    on networking, cybersecurity, and programmable data planes, leading to multiple publications in high-impact journals and conferences.

    Prior to joining Fort Lewis College, I gained extensive research experience through roles at the University of South Carolina 
    and the Catholic University of Asuncion. My work bridges academic excellence with industry certifications, focusing on 
    cutting-edge technologies like TCP Congestion Control, SDN, Open vSwitch, and programmable networking with P4.

    I am committed to fostering inclusive, hands-on learning environments, as reflected in my culturally responsive 
    Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) and NSF/ONR-funded workshop leadership. My goal is to equip students 
    with the skills and certifications necessary for successful careers in today's technology-driven economy.
